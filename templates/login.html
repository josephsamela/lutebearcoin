            <br>
            <p>Welcome to the Lute Bear Coin Network!<br>The most, uh trustworthy(?) cryptocurreny network run by bears who play instruments.</p>

            <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>When a transaction request is submitted, the bears look at it. If they approve, the transaction is added to the blockchain. Bears can't read.</p>

            <h2>Is It Decentralized?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Yes! We bought the bears a photocopy machine so they each have a copy of the ledger. This process is infallible and cannot be improved.</p>

            <h2>How Fast Are Transactions?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Honestly, it's pretty slow. Bears hibernate during the winter and spend the summer months eating salmon, berries and whatever people leave in dumpsters. But, they get to it eventually.</p>

            <h2>Does It Support NFTs?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Yes! Many great artworks are published and traded on the Lute Bear Coin network. I mean, most of the artwork is pretty bad. But don't tell the bears. It makes them feel sad.</p>
