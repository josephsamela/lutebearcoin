            <h1 id="title">Lute Bear Coin</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the Lute Bear Coin Blockchain Network! The most, uh trustworthy(?) cryptocurreny blockchain network owned and operated by bears who play instruments. Yeah, the bears also code and stuff.</p>
            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>Uh, well when a transaction request is submitted, one of the bears looks at it. If they approve the transaction is added to the blockchain. Bears can't read.</p>
            <h2>How do I submit a transaction?</h2>
            <p>Tell one of the bears and they'll probably figure it out. It's usually easiest to message them on Discord.</p>
            <h2>Is the blockchain decentralized?</h2>
            <p>Yes! We bought the bears a photocopy machine so they each have a copy.</p>
            <h2>How long do transactions take?</h2>
            <p>Honestly, it's pretty slow. Bears hibernate during the winter and spend the summer months eating salmon, bearries and whatever people leave in dumpsters. But, they usually get to it eventually.</p>
            <h2>Does it support NFTs?</h2>
            <p>Oh yeah, totally! Many great artworks are published and traded on the Lute Bear Coin network. I mean, most of the artwork is pretty bad - but you know it's fun or whatever.</p>
